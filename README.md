# first-aid-chatbot
chatbot code to give first aid instructions in a concise and unambiguous manner, even in remote locations


ABSTRACT:-
In the event of injury or sudden illness, failure to provide first aid could result in a casualty's death. The employer should ensure that an employee who is injured or taken ill at work receives immediate attention. But not everybody possesses the knowledge to do proper first-aid, and this will lead to prolonged discomfort, and this would be the best case scenario,worst being death.

All the instructions are online and not available for everyone at all times, and  a bit vast. This is where our first-aid chatbot comes into picture. our chatbot gives concise information and unambiguous first-aid instructions which can be accessed offline also and all you have to do is give one word command.

Remote diagnosis would allow less exposure to illness and infections lie for example when providers see patients remotely, they do not have to worry about exposure to any pathogens the patient may carry.

The chatbot also answers the covid FAQs.
