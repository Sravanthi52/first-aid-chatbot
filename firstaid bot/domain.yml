                    - grinding noise as injury happened
                    - swelling
                    - bruising
                    - deformation around injury
                    - broken bone

             Take these actions immediately while waiting for medical help:

              >Stop any bleeding. Apply pressure to the wound with a sterile bandage, 
               a clean cloth or a clean piece of clothing.
              >Immobilize the injured area. Don't try to realign the bone or push a bone
               that's sticking out back in. If you've been trained in how to splint and professional 
               help isn't readily available, apply a splint to the area above and below the fracture sites.
               Padding the splints can help reduce discomfort.
              >Apply ice packs to limit swelling and help relieve pain. Don't apply ice
               directly to the skin. Wrap the ice in a towel, piece of cloth or some other material.
              >Treat for shock. If the person feels faint or is breathing in short, rapid breaths, 
               lay the person down with the head slightly lower than the trunk and, if possible, elevate 
               the legs.
               
            Also call for emergency help if:
                
                >The person is unresponsive, isn't breathing or isn't moving. Begin CPR if 
                 there's no breathing or heartbeat.
                >There is heavy bleeding.
                >Even gentle pressure or movement causes pain.
                >The limb or joint appears deformed.
                >The bone has pierced the skin.
                >The extremity of the injured arm or leg, such as a toe or finger, is numb 
                 or bluish at the tip.
                >You suspect a bone is broken in the neck, head or back."

    - text: "If possible, take these steps while waiting for medical help:

             > Move beyond the snake's striking distance.
             > Remain still and calm to help slow the spread of venom.
             > Remove jewelry and tight clothing before you start to swell.
             > Position yourself, if possible, so that the bite is at or below the level of your heart.
             > Clean the wound with soap and water. Cover it with a clean, dry dressing.
              
              Caution:
              
              >Don't use a tourniquet or apply ice.
              >Don't cut the wound or attempt to remove the venom.
              >Don't drink caffeine or alcohol, which could speed your body's absorption of venom.
              >Don't try to capture the snake. Try to remember its color and shape so that you can 
               describe it, which will help in your treatment. If you have a smartphone with you and 
               it won't delay your getting help, take a picture of the snake from a safe distance to
               help with identification."

  utter_covid_intro:
  - text: "COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people with
           COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people become severely ill. Older adults
           and people who have certain underlying medical conditions are more likely to get 
           severely ill. Post-COVID conditions are a wide range of health problems people can 
           experience four or more weeks after first getting COVID-19.Even those who do not
           become severely ill from COVID-19 may experience post-COVID conditions."

  utter_covid_spread:
    - text: "COVID-19 is spread in three main ways:

             >Breathing in air when close to an infected person who is exhaling small
            droplets and particles that contain the virus.
             >Having these small droplets and particles that contain virus land on the eyes,
            nose, or mouth, especially through splashes and sprays like a cough or sneeze.
             >Touching eyes, nose, or mouth with hands that have the virus on them."

  utter_community_spread:
  - text: "Community spread means people have been infected with the virus 
           in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became 
           infected. Each health department determines community spread differently 
           based on local conditions. For information on community spread in 
           your area, please visit your local health department’s website."

  utter_community_levels:
   - text: "COVID-19 Community Levels are a tool to help communities decide 
            what prevention steps to take based on the latest data. Levels can 
            be low, medium, or high and are determined by looking at the percent 
            of hospital beds being used by patients with COVID-19, the rate of new 
            hospital admissions in the population, and the rate of new COVID-19 cases 
            in the community. People can take different steps depending on the 
            COVID-19 Community Level in their area."

  utter_covid_symptoms:
    - text: "People with COVID-19 have reported a wide range of issues from mild 
             symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure
             to the virus. If you have fever, cough, or other symptoms, you might have 
             COVID-19."

  utter_prevention:
    - text: "hear are some ways to prevent getting infected:
                  >Get Vaccinated and stay up to date on your COVID-19 vaccines

  utter_control_bleeding:
    - text: "Most forms of bleeding can be stopped with a combination of direct pressure 
             onto the wound and elevation of the wound above the heart. Always make sure 
             you put on gloves before touching someone else’s blood, I carry a few pairs of 
             these in my first aid kit.

             Hand the patient a piece of clean gauze and tell them to put pressure on their
             own wound as you put your gloves on. If the gauze is getting saturated, add more 
             gauze on top but do not remove any existing gauze that’s already in the wound.

             If the situation requires your hands to be free, or you’re having trouble keeping 
             pressure on the wound, you can make a pressure bandage. Place gauze over the wound 
             and wrap it tightly with something like an ace wrap or bandanna. Your goal is not to
             make a tourniquet, you should be able to slide two fingers under the wrap and the 
             patient should have no tingles or loss of feeling in the extremities."

  utter_wounds_infections:
    - text: "apply antiseptic or sanitiser(if no other option.try and dress the wound with a clean 
             cloth.Do not wash with water unless you are sure that water is pathogen free.
             
             If a wound is going to get infected, it will usually show up in the first 24-48 hours.
             You should stop the trip and evacuate any patient where you can’t control the bleeding 
             or there are persistent signs of a bad infection."

  utter_burns:
    - text: " The very first step for treating any burn is to stop the burning process. 
              Remove whatever the source of heat is and immediately cool the affected area with cold, 
              clean water. Depending on the thickness of the burn, it may take several minutes of soaking 
              in cold water before the burning process has stopped.
          
              Once the burned area has cooled off, you may want to scrub the area with clean water and a 
              bit of mild antibacterial soap, if it’s available. The goal is to prevent infection if the 
              burn goes deep into the skin.
              
              Next you should cover the burned area with antibiotic ointment and clean gauze or clothing. 
              This will help protect the burn site, and also help reduce the patient’s pain. Feel free to 
              offer the patient ibuprofen as well, as there will usually be substantial pain.
              
              For burns in extremities, keep the burned area elevated to reduce swelling. For more 
              long-term care, it’s important to keep the patient warm and well-hydrated since the major 
              risks to life are fluid loss (see dehydration and shock, below).
              
              Evacuate any burn patient if the burn:
              
                  >exposes deep layers of skin or bone
                  >is circumferential, going completely around a limb
                  >is on sensitive areas like the face, groin, armpit, hands or feet
                  >covers a significant part of a patient’s arm, leg or torso"

  utter_knee_ankle_injury:
    - text: "Whether they’re chronic injuries that flare up from over-use or sudden 
             injuries from a bad step on steep or uneven terrain, it’s important to stop 
             and address soft tissue injuries. Trying to “tough it out” can lead to 
             permanent, lifelong injuries that require ongoing physical therapy."

  utter_blisters:
    - text: " To treat blisters, the best option is to carefully and slowly drain it, 
              and then treat it like a minor wound. This will relieve the pressure and allow you 
              to continue on your way.
          
              Begin by washing the area around the blister thoroughly with water and then an 
              alcohol pad. Sterilize a sharp point with either alcohol or by holding it over a flame.
              
              To reduce the risk of cutting a jumpy, antsy patient, hold the sharp point so that it’s 
              nearly parallel with the skin of their foot, and slide it up into the bottom of the blister’s 
              roof. The skin of the blister should be dead, so the patient should only feel the tug of your 
              point lancing the outside of the blister, not any sharp pain.
              
              Once you’ve lanced a hole in the blister, leave the rest of the roof intact to protect the 
              inner layers of skin. Give the blister at least a few minutes to drain, applying light pressure 
              to help squeeze out the fluid. Then cover the area with antibiotic ointment to prevent your lanced
              hole from getting infected."

              1 breathing barrier (with one-way valve)
              1 instant cold compress
              2 pair of nonlatex gloves (size: large)
              2 hydrocortisone ointment packets
              1 3-inch gauze roll (roller) bandage
              1 roller bandage (4 inches wide)

              2 triangular bandages
              Tweezers
            
            Customize your kit
            Think about the healthcare needs of your family when putting together a first-aid kit. 
            For example:
            
            >If you have a family member with a severe allergy, include antihistamine medicine and 
            an epinephrine injector.
            >If you have elderly family members with fragile skin, including a roll of paper tape 
            can be useful for protecting delicate skin.
            >If you or a family member lives with diabetes, include a juice box, glucose tablets 
            and gels, and an emergency glucagon injection kit.
            >Chewable, baby aspirin might help someone who has coronary artery disease, provided 
            the person is not allergic to aspirin."
